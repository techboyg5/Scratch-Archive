# Scratch-Archive
This is a large archive of most Scratch and Scratch-related program files (only those that are working and have been found) from Scratch 0.1 (2003) to Scratch 2.0 (2013), as well as some Scratch modifications. Some of these files, which are Squeak .image files, also need a Squeak runtime engine, which can be found here: https://squeak.js.org/run/ To use a Scratch version or modification that uses .image files, go to the link, and drag-and-drop the .image file of the Scratch version/mod. Then, to launch it, go to https://squeak.js.org/run/#image=thenameoftheimagefile.image&swapButtons=true, and replace "thenameoftheimagefile" with the name of the Scratch version/mod. If you get any errors, click "Abandon" on them. I have also included a special version of Scratch 1.4 designed to run purely on the Raspberry Pi called GPIO Scratch. For more info, see the "About Scratch GPIO.md" file in this repository. About .exe files: obviously, on Windows, just run them normally. However, if you're a Linux user like me, use a tool called Wine, the website of which, and where you can find more information about it, is here: https://winehq.org/

No rights or ownership is claimed of any of these files. All Scratch program files created by the [MIT LLK Media Group](https://llk.media.mit.edu).
