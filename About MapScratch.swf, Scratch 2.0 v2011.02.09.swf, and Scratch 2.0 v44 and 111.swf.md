So, you might see some files called MapScratch.swf, Scratch 2.0 v2011.02.09.swf, and Scratch 2.0 v44/111.swf. However, these four files CANNOT be played through the online .swf player! To use them, launch Flash Player.exe; then click File > Open... > Browse... > [select MapScratch.swf, Scratch v2011.02.09.swf, or Scratch 2.0 v44/111.swf] > Open > Ok > done! If you're a Linux user like me, use Wine. For more information about Wine, please see README.md.
